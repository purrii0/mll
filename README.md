| `JUMP.EQ.0 <label>`   | Jump to `<label>` if top == 0 (non-destructive) |
| `JUMP.GT.0 <label>`   | Jump to `<label>` if top > 0 (non-destructive) |

```

## üî• Getting started
Write your .mll program in any text editor.

Run it through your interpreter:

```bash
./main.exe program.mll
```

## Example Program
program to check if the number is even or 
```ml
READ

loop:
PUSH 2
SUB

JUMP.GT.0 loop
JUMP.EQ.0 EVEN

PRINT "odd"
HALT

EVEN:
PRINT "even"
HALT
```
